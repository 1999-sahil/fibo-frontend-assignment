## Problem statement:
You need to develop the mobile responsive app that is present in the figma design. The application has the following functionalities.
+ User can track and untrack each goals
+ User can track all goals, by swipe to right feature
+ Whenever the goals are checked by user you need to also update the progress bar
+ Progress bar division = 100%/ No of total goals
+ You also need to create a graph based on the progress percentage. The graph has Percentage(on y-axis) and date(on x-axis). The graph is determined by the process percentage on each day
+ You need create bottom navigation menu, whenever the user click on any menu, you need to navigate on the respective page
+ Page2, Page3 and Page4 are blank page with their names in it
+ You need to save the data on frontend only

## Evaluation:
* We’ll be looking at completeness of assignment but will also be looking at clean coding style, code modularity like components, pages, props, etc
* Attention to detail in design developed - designs developed should look almost exactly the same as given in the below Figma design
* We’ll be looking at your ability to use core language concepts, but also your ability to pickup/use libraries specified. Where no library is explicitly specified, please go ahead and use whatever you feel comfortable with
